## Project Motivation
This is a webpage for [LANYEE], my mom's little jewelry store on Taobao (https://shop467712046.taobao.com/?spm=a230r.7195193.1997079397.13.10f4285aFLxCE8)

## Project Summary
Taking advantage of the Twitter Bootstrap library, I created a responsive webpage with picture, video, and animation. The page suffices all basic commercial needs for LANYEE and businesses of the similar kind.
